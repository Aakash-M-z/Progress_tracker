## About the Project

Progress Tracker is a full-stack web application built to help developers stay consistent with their Data Structures and Algorithms practice.

Instead of solving problems randomly across platforms, this tool helps you log your activity, visualize your improvement, and maintain discipline throughout your preparation journey.

It is designed for students preparing for coding interviews, competitive programming, and placement exams.

## Core Features

### Activity Tracking
- Log solved problems with difficulty, platform, time spent, and notes  
- Categorize problems by topic and problem type  
- Track progress across platforms such as LeetCode, CodeForces, and HackerRank  

### Structured Learning Roadmap
- Follow a topic-by-topic DSA roadmap  
- Mark topics as completed or in progress  
- Filter topics by difficulty and category  

### Analytics and Visualization
- Daily activity heatmap to monitor consistency  
- Topic-wise and difficulty-wise performance insights  
- Visual trends showing long-term progress  

### Motivation and Productivity
- Daily streak tracking  
- Milestone-based progress monitoring  
- Built-in motivational quotes  

### User Experience
- Fully responsive design  
- Clean dark theme with minimal distractions  
- Smooth animations and intuitive layout
